    <h3>Gusto kita.</h3>

    <p>
        I’ve been meaning to say this for a while and kept thinking when or where should I tell you, but I never
        really knew the right moment. So I thought I’d say it in my own way using the things I love to do and making this for you.
    </p>

    <p>
        I like you. Not just because of the small things, but because of how you make me feel.
        The way you talk when we're debating on stupid things and joke around a lot,
        the way you smile that makes my heart melt and happy, and the way you unknowingly make ordinary moments feel
        lighter and memorable every time.
    </p>

    <p>
        There’s no pressure in this, and no expectations.
        I just wanted you to know how I feel about you, honestly telling what you mean to me and sincerely telling the truth.
    </p>

    <p>
        Whatever you feel is okay.
        I’m just thankful I got to tell you the truth.
    </p>
